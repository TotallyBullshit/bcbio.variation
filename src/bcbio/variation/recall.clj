  "Recall batched sets of variants containing no-call regions.
  Combined variant calls from batches contain regions called in
  some samples but not others. The approach:
    - Split sample into called and no-call variants
    - Re-call the no-call variants using the UnifiedGenotyper
    - Merge previously called and re-called into final set.
