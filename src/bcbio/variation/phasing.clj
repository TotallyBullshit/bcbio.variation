  "Support phased haplotype comparisons between variant calls.
   Compares a phased set of calls versus haploid reference calls.

   The comparison logic is:

   - Group calls into regions based on phasing
   - For each phase region:
     - Determine which set of haploid alleles to compare with the reference
     - With each position in this haploid:
       - Compare to reference allele
       - If mismatch and alternate allele matches reference, then phasing error
       - If mismatch and neither allele matches, then calling error"
