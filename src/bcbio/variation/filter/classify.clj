          These contain the `set` key value pair with information about supporting

          compare based on novelty in dbSNP. Novel and know have different inclusion
          parameters derived from examining real true/false calls in replicate
          experiments. The logic for inclusion is:

          - We exclude low mapping quality reads, which end up being non-representative
            of more general cases since they are poorly represented in true positives.
            This is worth looking at more for generalizing the approach to these regions.
          - Include indels in low entropy regions which are often problematic.
          - Include novel variants not found in dbSNP that have low read support.
