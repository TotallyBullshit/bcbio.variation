  "Provide a faster way to compare two VCF files, making additional use of memory.
   This is useful for comparing a larger file (whole genome sequencing) to a
   smaller one (array genotyping) where the smaller positions and genotypes
   can be loaded into memory.
   This could also be split by chromosome to reduce memory requirement but
   first pass uses the entire file."
